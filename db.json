Find a data set that interests you about a topic you are passionate about. I have an aggregated list of data repositories you can explore (link in my bio)⠀\n⠀\n☑ Conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)⠀\n⠀\nOnce you have your data set, load it up into Python/R/whatever and start exploring. What relationships exist within your data? What variables are of interest to you? Is there an outcome variable you would like to predict? What are some tools you might want to use to extract insights from your data? ⠀\n⠀\n☑ Ask questions⠀\n⠀\nBased on the results of your EDA, what might be some business relevant questions you could answer in an analysis? What insights would you want to gain to help make business decisions using this data? ⠀\n⠀\nPro Tip: It's always a good idea to ask general questions first and as you get more familiar with your data, update those initial questions into more precise questions.⠀\n⠀\n☑ Get to work⠀\n⠀\nStart researching and coding solutions to the questions you are interested in solving. Feel free to ask more questions as new insights reveal themselves to you in your analysis. Let your curiosity and intuition drive you.⠀\n⠀\n☑ Create a final report of your findings⠀\n⠀\nOnce you feel like you've answered your questions to the best of your abilities, it's time to communicate your findings into a nice final report. Be sure to include visualizations you made, any statistical tests you used, the models you created as well as the final results of your analysis. It's also worth including how your project could be improved in the future and what additional resources might be helpful.⠀\n⠀\nDon't worry about being perfect with your first project. No one's going to see it. Just get into the routine of building projects from start to finish. As you do more and more projects, you'll analytical skills and confidence levels will skyrocket🚀⠀\n⠀\nDid I miss anything? What else would you advise to someone making their very first Data Science project?",

I have to import more than 20,000 lines of Excel files in a Postgresql database 😬\n➖➖\nI use SheetJS to retrieve data from Excel files. It's a really powerful library. Really small runtime. I'd advise, if you ever get a task like this 💪\n➖➖\nI managed to import some data. But I have a problem when I want to import a lot of lines. I'll have to see how to do it tomorrow. It's a rather complex import, because it's for sure several files and I have to merge data and also do some checks before adding to the database 😬😬\n➖➖\nWhat are you doing this week? 💪🤔",

But the project is pretty cool 😊\n➖➖\nI'm trying to rest too, it's important to take time and do nothing 😉 Tonight -> Netflix, I'm watching Vikings. It's a show I recommend 🙋‍♂️\n➖➖\nHow's your weekend going? Are you working on a project? 🤔",

Now, every day has the same pattern, so I don't really notice that it is weekend. Do you feel the same? Stay safe and don't forget to relex!",

And it'll be worth every minute you spend alone at night, thinking and thinking about what it is you want to design or build. It'll be worth it, I promise.”)\n.\ncoding is not all the time looking happy. It is actually looking like this and thinking: why the hell my doesn’t my code work? Where does this bug come from now? Why is my code behaving weird?! How do I make it now? And a lot of other questions.\nWe are always smiling for the picture but the reality is not always that.\n.\nWe all have problems, difficulties and moments of doubt. And it is all ok! Because people who code are people who solve problems and overcome their doubts! Our best friends are Google, Stackoverflow, Dev Tools, console.log and background-color: balck 🤪🤪 In the end, we are able to build great things!\nHow do you deal with your problems while coding? Do you have a lot of these moments or not so much? What is your experience with this all?\nPost [AR] in comments 🇪🇬👇\n_________________________\n#devinitelyhealthy \n#softwareengineer #kotlin \n#webdesigner#peoplewhocode \n#coding #developerlife\n#frontenddeveloper #backenddeveloper#fullstackdeveloper #developer\n#webdeveloper #thedevlife\n #coder #learntocode ‏#programmer\n#100daysofcode #coderlife\n#softwaredeveloper #android\n #developerlife #programming #worldcode #webdesigner #webdevelopment ‎#programmerslife ‎#softwaredevelopment\n#buildupdevs ‎#365daysofcode ‎#javascript #html",

I remember when I first started learning fullstack I thought it was really challenging but it turns out... it's not hard at all! I have learned so much already.\nMy next steps are unmounting my components to clear the state.\nI also have rethought about how my data is structured when the user enters the instructions and ingredients. So I'll be changing somethings around. I hope I will be able to deploy the first version this week.\nI am feeling good and productive! I hope you guys are too!
